            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-xs">How to get blood test results</h3>
            <p>If you have a blood test, the results are usually sent to your GP.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>get a phone call if the GP thinks you need a follow-up appointment</li>
              <li>or if everything is fine you might not hear anything</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you do not hear anything after 2 weeks, you can phone your GP surgery and ask them to check if your results have come in.</p>



            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-xs">How to find your NHS number</h3>

            <p>You can find your NHS number on any letters you’ve had from the NHS.</p>

            </ul>

            <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-xs">If you cannot find your NHS number</h3>

            <p>Ask at your GP surgery if you cannot find your NHS number. They should be able to tell you what it is.</p>

            <p>If you do not have a GP, you’ll need to register with a GP surgery to get an NHS number.</p>
